Description: Implements a Fellegi-Sunter probabilistic record linkage model that allows for missing data
    and the inclusion of auxiliary information. This includes functionalities to conduct a merge of two datasets under the Fellegi-Sunter model
    using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. In addition, tools for preparing, adjusting, and summarizing
    data merges are included. The package implements methods described in Enamorado, Fifield,
    and Imai (2017) ''Using a Probabilistic Model to Assist Merging of Large-scale Administrative
    Records'', available at <http://imai.princeton.edu/research/linkage.html>.
